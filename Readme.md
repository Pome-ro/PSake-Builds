# PSAKE Builds
This is just where I'm centrally storing all the changes I make to the build process for my Scripts and Modules. At some point I'd like to create a command to initialize a new project, that pulls either one of these folders down, renames the required files, fills in the blanks with some information, and initilized a Git repo, to make project creation easier. 

Would be interesting to build a task within these psake files to self update the build process as well, so all my scripts\modules are always using my psake build process.
